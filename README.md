This Python script was born out of a practical need to maintain identical copies of files in different locations within a Windows environment, without the hassle of manually updating each copy whenever changes occur. By leveraging the power of hard links, this tool ensures that a single file can exist in multiple locations, with all copies being automatically updated when any one of them is modified. This approach not only saves time but also minimizes the risk of inconsistencies between file versions.

The script uses a graphical interface for selecting files and their destination directories. Utilizing the `tkinter` module for its user-friendly file and directory selection dialogs, and the `subprocess` module to execute Windows' native `mklink` command, the script simplifies what would otherwise be a complex process of creating hard links.
